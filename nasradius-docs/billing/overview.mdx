## Plans vs Vouchers vs Coupons

| Feature | Plans | Vouchers | Coupons |
|---------|-------|----------|---------|
| Purpose | Define service packages | Grant access | Custom promotions |
| Created by | Admin | System (on purchase) | Admin (from plan) |
| Assigned to | N/A | Specific customer | Specific customer |
| Validity | N/A | Time-limited | Custom validity |

## How Billing Works

### Hotspot Billing

1. **Customer makes payment** (M-PESA, manual, etc.)
2. **Balance credited** to customer account
3. **Customer purchases plan** (or voucher assigned)
4. **Voucher generated** with expiry time
5. **Internet access** granted until expiry

### PPPoE Billing

1. **Customer assigned profile** with internet plan
2. **Payment received** (monthly subscription)
3. **Profile remains active** for billing period
4. **Renewal required** at end of period

## Plan Properties

When creating an internet plan, you define:

| Property | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Name | Display name | "Daily Unlimited" |
| Code | Unique identifier | "DAILY-UNL-001" |
| Price | Cost in local currency | 50 |
| Validity | Duration of access | 24 hours |
| Data Limit | Maximum data (or unlimited) | 2GB or Unlimited |
| Speed | Upload/Download rates | 5M/10M |
