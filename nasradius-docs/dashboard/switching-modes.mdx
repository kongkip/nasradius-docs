### Sidebar Changes

When switching modes, the sidebar navigation remains mostly the same. However:

- **Kopa** appears prominently in Hotspot mode
- **Payment Settings** tab is only available in Hotspot mode's Settings page

## Tenant Feature Restrictions

<Warning>
  Some tenants may have only one mode enabled. If your account only supports Hotspot or PPPoE, the other mode's button will be disabled.
</Warning>

When a mode is disabled:
- The toggle button is grayed out
- Clicking it has no effect
- The system automatically uses the enabled mode

## When to Use Each Mode

  <Accordion icon="wifi" title="Use Hotspot Mode When">
    - Managing WiFi hotspots in cafes, hotels, or public spaces
    - Using voucher-based authentication
    - Offering time-limited or data-limited packages

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="router" title="Use PPPoE Mode When">

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Toggle not appearing | Refresh the page or check if tenant has both modes enabled |
| Mode not switching | Check browser console for errors; try clearing cache |
| Data not updating | Refresh the page after switching modes |
| Wrong mode on login | The system defaults to PPPoE; use toggle to switch |
