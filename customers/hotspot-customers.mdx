## Customer Balance

### How Balance Works

```
Balance = Payments Received - Vouchers Purchased
```

| Action | Effect on Balance |
|--------|-------------------|
| Payment received | Balance increases |
| Voucher purchased | Balance decreases |
| Voucher expired | No change (already deducted) |

### Low Balance Alerts

If you've configured Balance Reminders in Settings, customers with low balance will receive automatic SMS notifications.
